                    <p id="center">The first product we put on the market this year was Pia Fantastica, a toilet seat that besides being colorful and being the cheapest sanitation solution in the market, uses only one glass of water for each flush. We are currently testing the use of Black Soldier fly larvae that inoculated in the pit, can consume the fecal sludge reducing the need for emptying.
                        <br>In addition to Pia Fantastica and the BSF larvae we have been promoting environmental awareness campaigns in neighborhoods about sanitation, hygiene and environmental health. We are also implementing a training programs for young entrepreneurs that are learning more about the themes already mentioned but focusing on marketing and entrepreneurship so that they become autonomous promoters of our products

The toilet is produced on a concrete base, presenting the oval-mouthed, being designed to ensure the comfort  of the user. It also presents the particularity of having a pipe with 45º slope without siphon which reduces the amount of water required for each discharge, tests performed so far show that PIA FANTASTICA can use no more than 2Dl of water in each flush.
