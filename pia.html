            <p id="info">The first product we put on the market was Pia Fantastica, a toilet that besides being colorful and being the cheapest sanitation solution in the market, uses only one glass of water for each flush. The toilet is produced on a concrete base, presenting the oval-mouthed, being designed to ensure the comfort  of the user. It also presents the particularity of having a pipe with 45ยบ slope without siphon which reduces the amount of water required for each discharge, tests performed so far show that PIA FANTASTICA can use no more than 2Dl of water in each flush.
                The Fantastic toilet is arranged in the market in 4 production lines, Basica, Unicolor, Multicolor and Personalized, the element that differs the production lines is painting, and those with less tint are arranged in the market at the best price and those that need more technique in painting or more material are arranged at a higher price.
