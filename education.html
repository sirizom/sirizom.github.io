			<p id="info">This is an action that we normally do as a  regular activity but we also do in partnership with NGOs that have projects on sanitation or environmental education and they hire us to use our experience in  field work to go and communicate with the population, the campaigns often take place in markets and open spaces  but we also do one on one approach and radio communications.</p>
